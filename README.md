Hi, I’m Vamsi Makke 👋. I’m a backend engineer who builds systems that are fast, reliable, and don’t freak out when lots of people use them. I work with Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, Redis, and SQL. If it runs behind the scenes and can be made better, I’m on it ⚙️.

I finished my Master’s in Information Technology at the University of Cincinnati with a 4.0 GPA 🎓. I’ve also solved over 1,300 LeetCode problems and ranked in the top 7.5 percent worldwide. I guess I like solving puzzles more than I should 💪.

Here’s what I worked on during my internships:

**TORQ Sports, Software Engineering Intern 🚀**

- Built a home feed algorithm from scratch that sorts content and shows the right stuff at the right time. It helped increase user activity by 50 percent 📈  
- Fixed slow SQL queries and made them 55 percent faster ⏱️  
- Made API endpoints more secure with better validation and token checks 🔒  
- Cut page load times by 40 percent by cleaning up how the API talks to the database ⚡

**NERDS, University of Cincinnati, Software Engineer Intern 🧪**

- Made APIs with Spring Boot and Python to handle research data safely and quickly 🔧  
- Used Kafka and Redis to speed up API responses by 40 percent 🚀  
- Deployed services on AWS and used Docker to keep everything running smoothly as we grew ☁️  
- Automated deployments with GitHub Actions so we could release faster and with less stress 🤖

**Cognizant Technology Solutions, Software Engineer Intern 💼**

- Built a full-stack web app with Spring Boot, React, and MySQL that got users more engaged 📊  
- Improved slow SQL queries and optimized indexes so the database worked better 🛠️  
- Created backend tools and scripts to watch system performance and fix problems quickly 👀  
- Worked in Agile teams, shipped features, reviewed code, and fixed bugs without losing my cool 👨‍💻

When I’m not coding, I’m usually messing with cloud setups, solving algorithm problems, or yelling at FC Barcelona like I’m their coach ⚽🔥.
