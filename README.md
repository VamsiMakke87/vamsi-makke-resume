Hi, I’m Vamsi Makke 👋. I’m a backend engineer who builds systems that stay fast, scalable, and don’t freak out when real users actually show up. I work with Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, Redis, and SQL. If it runs on the backend and can be optimized, I’ve probably poked at it ⚙️.

I recently finished my Master’s in Information Technology at the University of Cincinnati with a perfect 4.0 GPA 🎓. Along the way, I solved over 1,300 LeetCode problems and landed in the top 7.5 percent worldwide. Mostly because I like turning brain-benders into warm-up exercises 💪.

Here’s what I actually did during my internships:

**TORQ Sports, Software Engineering Intern 🚀**

- Built a TikTok-style home feed algorithm from scratch using rank-based sorting, cursor pagination, and engagement signals. User activity shot up by 50 percent 📈  
- Tamed some painfully slow SQL queries and slashed response times by 55 percent ⏱️  
- Locked down API endpoints with strict validation and token checks, making it harder for attackers and easier for users 🔒  
- Cut page load times by 40 percent by cleaning up API-to-database chatter ⚡

**NERDS, University of Cincinnati, Software Engineer Intern 🧪**

- Crafted Spring Boot and Python APIs to handle sensitive research data safely and swiftly 🔧  
- Used Kafka and Redis to speed up API responses by 40 percent, because nobody likes waiting 🚀  
- Deployed services on AWS EC2 and containerized everything with Docker so scaling didn’t turn into a disaster ☁️  
- Automated deployments with GitHub Actions to avoid those “it works on my machine” moments 🤖

**Cognizant Technology Solutions, Software Engineer Intern 💼**

- Created a full-stack web app using Spring Boot, React, and MySQL that boosted user engagement by 30 percent 📊  
- Rewrote sluggish SQL queries and optimized indexes to make the database breathe easier 🛠️  
- Built backend logic and Python scripts to monitor performance and catch issues before they became fires 👀  
- Survived Agile sprints, shipped production code, reviewed teammates’ work, and squashed bugs without losing my mind 👨‍💻

When I’m not writing code, you’ll find me tweaking cloud infrastructure, chasing down algorithm edge cases, or yelling at FC Barcelona like I’m their unpaid tactical advisor ⚽🔥.
