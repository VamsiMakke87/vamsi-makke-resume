### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Vamsi Makke!

Iâ€™m a **Software Engineer** who loves building scalable, high-performance systems. With experience across **Java, Spring Boot, ReactJS, Kafka, Redis, MySQL**, and more, I specialize in crafting backend solutions that are **fast, reliable, and secure**.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve worked on everything from RESTful APIs to full-stack web apps, both independently and as part of dynamic teams. During my internships at **TORQ Sports**, **NERDS at the University of Cincinnati**, and **Cognizant**, Iâ€™ve:

* Reduced SQL response times by up to **40%**
* Enabled **70% better traceability** via structured HTTP logging
* Improved API performance with **Redis caching** and **Kafka streaming**

ðŸŽ“ Recently completed my **Masterâ€™s in Information Technology** at the **University of Cincinnati** (GPA: **4.0/4.0**), Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex problems â€” with **1300+ LeetCode challenges** solved and a global ranking in the **top 7.5%**.

âš½ When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll catch me solving algorithms, exploring cloud tech, or cheering for **FC Barcelona**!
