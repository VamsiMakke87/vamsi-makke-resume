# Vamsi Makke 
Hello! I'm Vamsi Makke, a passionate and detail-oriented Software Engineer with expertise in Java, Spring Boot, ReactJS, and a variety of other modern technologies. Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Information Technology, I have hands-on experience in building scalable, high-performance applications using tools like Apache Kafka, Docker, MySQL, and Redis.

In addition to my academic knowledge, I have worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Cognizant Technology Solutions and NERDS at the University of Cincinnati, where I contributed to full-stack web applications, API development, and CI/CD pipeline optimization. I'm passionate about leveraging my skills to solve complex problems, improve system performance, and contribute to innovative projects.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring the latest in tech, solving algorithms on LeetCode, or cheering for FC Barcelona!
